I’m interested in all things data- & nanoscience, currently working on the the determination of environmental concentrations of particles in the nanorange.
I can be reached at aresb@hi.no (work) or arebru@gmail.com (private). I am always open for collaboration and highly appreciate interest in my work. Get in touch!
